Difference between Revert & Reset & Restore

->revert & reset 
Revert we use in both local & server
Reset we use in local not in server
If we use reset in server some datas may get deleted 

->Assume we created two files 
click ls
a.txt  ,  b.txt -> 2 files created

                       
vi a.txt
// it open a file 
//->(Eg) hello a1
//next esc:wq

git commit -a -m "a1"
// it show one file a1 commited




vi b.txt
// it open a file 
//(Eg) hello b1
//next esc:wq

git commit -a -m "b1"
//it show commited one file b1 commited




vi a.txt
// it open a file 
//and it show hello a1
//->(Eg) hello a2
//next esc:wq

git commit -a -m "a2"
//it show commited one file a2 commited



vi b.txt
// it open a file 
//and it show hello b1
//->(Eg) hello b2
//next esc:wq

git commit -a -m "b2"
//it show commited one file b2 commited


                      
if we want to check it
git log --oneline
// it show 4 commits with id
(head -> main)
a1,b1,a2,b2

^c git log --oneline

...


now git revert command

git revert --hard head~1
//it ask u want to modify

 
git log --oneline
//it show ->revert "a1"-> Extra revert created with new id
//what we did in "a1" it all removed & created in new revert command "a1"
Then it show 5 id for 4 commits

->This the difference bw Revert vs Reset
==================


What is Restore

//we created a file "vss.txt"

ls
//it show vss.txt

git status
//it show status


mv vss.txt vss.html
// mv-> move (rename)

ls
//it show vss.html

git status
// it show vss.txt has deleted 
// it show vss.html has created
-> here we know tat we not deleted (just we renamed)
-> but git didnot understand


solution
git add vss.html
// for going to staging area


git add vss.txt
// for going to staging area 




git status
// now we see renamed:  vss.txt ->vss.html
//"use git restore --staged <file>... " and ask to commit 



git commit -m "rename vss"
//it gets commited


ls
//we see channel.html
